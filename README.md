# Implementing List,Map,Queue with Junit tests

## 1. Implement the following data structures using the interfaces given.
    1. Linked List (using List interface)
        A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored 
        at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers 
    2. Hash Map (using Map interface)
        HashMap is a Map based collection class that is used for storing Key & value pairs, it is denoted as HashMap<Key, Value> or HashMap<K, V>. 
    3. Simple Queue (using Queue interface)
        A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

## 2. Write unit tests for all the functions in your implementation
 
## 3. Solve the following problems using your implementations
    1. Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. 
    Where k is a given positive integer. For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, 
    the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in 
    linked list.
